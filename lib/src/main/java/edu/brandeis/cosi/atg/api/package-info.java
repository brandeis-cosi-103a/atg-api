/**
 * This library contains interfaces and type definitions for _Automation: The Game_ (ATG). ATG is
 * derived from the popular card game Dominion, and is used for a semester-long programming project
 * in Cosi-103a at Brandeis University.
 *
 * There are two primary interfaces to implement: {@link Player Player} and {@link Engine}
 *
 * A Player participates in a game. An Engine executes a full game, and produces a score.
