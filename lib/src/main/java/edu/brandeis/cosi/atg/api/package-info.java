/**
 * This library contains interfaces and type definitions for <i>Automation: The Game</i> (ATG). ATG is
 * derived from the popular card game Dominion, and is used for a semester-long programming project
 * in Cosi-103a at Brandeis University.
 * <br/><br/>
 * There are two primary interfaces to implement: {@link Player Player} and {@link Engine}
 * <br/><br/>
 * A Player participates in a game. An Engine executes a full game, and produces a score.
